        This website serves as a comprehensive resource for students and
        practitioners of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). It covers fundamental
        interaction models, cognitive frameworks like GOMS and KLM, and
        practical design focus areas to help bridge the gap between human users
        and computer systems.

          <h2>Biography</h2>

          <img src="norman.jpg" alt="Portrait of Don Norman" />

          <p></p>
          <p>
            <strong>Donald Norman</strong> is a pioneer in the field of
            Human–Computer Interaction, known for his work on user-centered
            design, usability, and cognitive engineering. His model of
            interaction is influential because it aligns with our intuitive
            understanding of how users engage with technology.
          </p>
        </section>
        <p>
          Norman’s model of interaction is perhaps the most influential in
          Human–Computer Interaction, possibly because of its closeness to our
          intuitive understanding of the interaction between human user and
          computer. The user formulates a plan of action, which is then executed
          at the computer interface. When the plan, or part of the plan, has
          been executed, the user observes the computer interface to evaluate
          the result of the executed plan, and to determine further actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The interactive cycle can be divided into two major phases:
          <strong>execution</strong> and <strong>evaluation</strong>. These can
          then be subdivided into seven stages:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Establishing the goal.</li>
          <li>Forming the intention.</li>
          <li>Specifying the action sequence.</li>
          <li>Executing the action.</li>
          <li>Perceiving the system state.</li>
          <li>Interpreting the system state.</li>
          <li>
            Evaluating the system state with respect to the goals and
            intentions.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          Norman uses this model to demonstrate why some interfaces cause
          problems to their users. He describes these in terms of the
          <strong>gulf of execution</strong> and the
          <strong>gulf of evaluation</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <strong>gulf of execution</strong> is the difference between the
          user’s formulation of the actions to reach the goal and the actions
          allowed by the system. <br />The
          <strong>gulf of evaluation</strong> is the distance between the
          physical presentation of the system state and the expectation of the
          user.

      <h2>Human Error – Slips and Mistakes</h2>
      <p>
        Human errors are often classified into <em>slips</em> and
        <em>mistakes</em>. These can be distinguished using Norman’s
        <strong>gulf of execution</strong>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Slips:</strong> If you understand a system well, you have
          formulated the right action but fail to execute it correctly—for
          example, mistyping or accidentally pressing a button at the wrong
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mistakes:</strong> If you do not know the system well, you may
          not formulate the right goal—for example, thinking a magnifying glass
          icon is for 'finding' when it is actually for 'magnifying'.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Understanding the type of error is vital for design:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Slips</strong> may be corrected by better screen design, such
          as adding more space between buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mistakes</strong> require a better understanding of the
          system, often needing radical redesign, improved training, or a
          different metaphor for use.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>GOMS</h2>
      <p>
        The GOMS model, developed by Card, Moran, and Newell, is an acronym for
        <strong>Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection</strong>. It provides a
        framework for describing the cognitive and physical steps required to
        complete a task.
      </p>

      <article>
        <h3>The Four Elements of GOMS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Goals:</strong> These represent what the user wants to
            achieve and serve as "memory points" for evaluating progress or
            returning to after an error.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operators:</strong> These are the lowest level of analysis,
            representing basic actions like pressing a key or reading a dialog
            box.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Methods:</strong> These describe the different ways a goal
            can be achieved, such as using a menu versus a keyboard shortcut.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Selection:</strong> These are rules that predict which
            method a user will choose based on the system state or user habits.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <h3>Design Focus: GOMS saves money</h3>
      <p>
        A real-world application of GOMS occurred when the telephone company
        NYNEX used it to analyze a proposed computer system. The analysis
        revealed the new system would actually be slower than the old one,
        leading the company to abandon the project and save millions of dollars.

    <section id="klm-model">
      <h2>12.5.1 Keystroke-level model (KLM)</h2>
      <p>
        The Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) provides detailed predictions about user
        performance by focusing on the human motor system. It is designed for
        <strong>unit tasks</strong>—simple command sequences that typically take
        less than 20 seconds, such as changing a font or using
        search-and-replace.
      </p>

      <p>
        KLM assumes the user is an expert and focuses solely on the
        <strong>execution phase</strong> of a task. The model decomposes this
        phase into seven specific operators:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>K (Keystroking):</strong> Striking keys, including modifiers
          like Shift.
        </li>
        <li><strong>B (Button press):</strong> Pressing a mouse button.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>P (Pointing):</strong> Moving the mouse to a specific target.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>H (Homing):</strong> Moving hands between the mouse and the
          keyboard.
        </li>
        <li><strong>D (Drawing):</strong> Drawing lines using the mouse.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>M (Mental preparation):</strong> Pausing to mentally prepare
          for a physical action.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>R (System response):</strong> The time the user must wait for
          the system.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Operator Times</h3>
      <p>
        The total time to execute a task is calculated by summing the times for
        each operator:
        <em
          >T<sub>execute</sub> = T<sub>K</sub> + T<sub>B</sub> + T<sub>P</sub> +
          T<sub>H</sub> + T<sub>D</sub> + T<sub>M</sub> + T<sub>R</sub></em
        >.
      </p>

          <tr>
            <td>H</td>
            <td>Home hands to/from keyboard</td>
            <td>0.40</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>Drawing – domain dependent</td>
            <td>-</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>M</td>
            <td>Mentally prepare</td>
            <td>1.35</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>R</td>
            <td>Response from system</td>
            <td>-</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        The power of KLM lies in <strong>comparison</strong>. It allows
        designers to compare different systems or different methods within the
        same system to see which is fastest without needing to conduct lengthy
        experiments with real users.
