          <h3>What is HCI?</h3>
          <p>
            Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field that brings together
            <strong>human cognitive psychology</strong>,
            <strong>design principles</strong>, and
            <strong>computer science</strong> to improve how people interact
            with digital systems. Its main objective is to make systems
            efficient, usable, and user-friendly.

          <h3>Human Behavior and Learned Patterns</h3>
          <p>
            People often perform tasks based on habits formed early in life or
            by observing others. For example, when asked to draw a glass, most
            individuals rely on memory rather than observation. Although
            behaviors and habits can be modified over time, a person’s core
            nature tends to remain consistent.

          <h3>Common Types of Interfaces</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Graphical User Interface (GUI) – interaction through visual
              elements
            </li>
            <li>
              Command Line Interface (CLI) – interaction using text commands
            </li>
            <li>Voice-based Interface – interaction using spoken input</li>
            <li>
              Gesture-based Interface – interaction through physical movements

          <h3>Human Memory Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Human beings process and store information using different memory
            systems:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Short-Term Memory (STM):</strong> temporarily holds
              limited information
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-Term Memory (LTM):</strong> stores information for
              extended periods
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sensory Memory:</strong> briefly retains sensory input
              such as sight and sound
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Cognitive Neural Networks</h3>
          <p>
            Cognitive Neural Networks are inspired by how the human brain works.
            They recognize and organize information by identifying patterns like
            shapes, colors, and textures, similar to how humans perceive
            objects.

          <h3>Fitts’ Law</h3>
          <p>
            Fitts’ Law explains how long it takes for a user to move to a target
            on a screen. The movement time increases when the target is far away
            or small in size. This principle plays an important role in
            interface design and influenced the development of pointing devices
            such as the mouse.

        <article>
          <h3>Chunking Technique</h3>
          <p>
            Chunking is a cognitive strategy that makes information easier to
            remember by dividing it into smaller, meaningful units. A common
            example is writing a phone number as
            <strong>123-456-7890</strong> instead of a long continuous sequence.

            <h3>Atomic Syringe Example</h3>

          </article>
          <p>
            The Automatic Syringe case demonstrates how minor design flaws can
            result in major real-world consequences. Poor keypad layout caused
            users to enter incorrect values, leading to serious risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            This case highlights that interface design is an iterative process.
            Initial designs are rarely perfect and must be refined through
            testing. Early prototypes should be simple and flexible so they can
            be easily changed or replaced. Techniques such as paper prototypes
            and quick mock-ups help designers improve interfaces efficiently.

          <h3>Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            The <strong>Gulf of Execution</strong> refers to the difficulty
            users face when translating their goals into actions that the system
            supports.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Gulf of Evaluation</strong> refers to how hard it is for
            users to understand the system’s response and determine whether
            their goal was achieved.

          <h3>Activity 5: Splitwise and Social Coordination</h3>

          <h4>Applying HCI Concepts</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Cognitive Load:</strong> Users must mentally remember
              individual orders and prices, placing stress on working memory.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social Pressure:</strong> Talking about money in groups is
              uncomfortable, encouraging users to trust the app’s calculations
              without verification.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unclear Feedback:</strong> If it is not obvious who has
              paid, users struggle to understand the current financial state.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>External Cognition:</strong> By showing calculations
              visually, the interface reduces mental effort and improves
              clarity.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Design Objective</h3>
          <p>
            The primary goal is to minimize social tension while ensuring
            accurate and transparent bill splitting to prevent
            misunderstandings.
          </p>

          <h3>Gulf Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Execution Gulf:</strong> The complexity involved in entering
            detailed orders and splits within the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Evaluation Gulf:</strong> The challenge users face in
            confirming whether the final balance matches the real payments made.
